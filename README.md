# SleepLogger

A WinForms app to track sleep and view related statistics.

## Stack
- Language: C# 9.0
- Environment: .NET 6
- Framework: Winforms
- Testing: NUnit

## Support
*SleepLogger* will only work on Windows.

Why? Because I don't like making large-scale apps in JavaScript (with Electron), 
and haven't gotten to learning TypeScript yet (wanted to dive deeper into the .NET ecosystem).
